/**
 * Browser speech recognition, wrapped for React.
 *
 * This is the real Web Speech API — `window.SpeechRecognition`, or the
 * `webkit-` prefixed build Chrome and Edge still ship. Nothing here invents
 * text: if the engine returns nothing, the transcript stays empty and the
 * caller shows an error. Recognition runs against the browser's own service,
 * so an unsupported browser is reported rather than silently faked.
 *
 * TODO(api): for browsers without the API, record with MediaRecorder and POST
 * the blob to /api/voice/transcribe (Whisper). The shape returned here —
 * { transcript, language } — is what that endpoint should answer with, so the
 * recorder component will not need to change.
